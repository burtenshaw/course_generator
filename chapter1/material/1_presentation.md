# Welcome to the ðŸ¤— Course!

This course will teach you about large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem â€” [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets), [ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), and [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) â€” as well as the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). It's completely free and without ads.

# Understanding NLP and LLMs

While this course was originally focused on NLP (Natural Language Processing), it has evolved to emphasize Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent the latest advancement in the field. 

**What's the difference?**
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** is the broader field focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP encompasses many techniques and tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.
- **LLMs (Large Language Models)** are a powerful subset of NLP models characterized by their massive size, extensive training data, and ability to perform a wide range of language tasks with minimal task-specific training. Models like the Llama, GPT, or Claude series are examples of LLMs that have revolutionized what's possible in NLP.

Throughout this course, you'll learn about both traditional NLP concepts and cutting-edge LLM techniques, as understanding the foundations of NLP is crucial for working effectively with LLMs.

Let's start by understanding the difference between NLP and LLMs. NLP, or Natural Language Processing, is a broad field that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It encompasses various techniques and tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. On the other hand, LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a subset of NLP models known for their massive size and ability to perform a wide range of language tasks with minimal task-specific training. Throughout this course, we'll explore both traditional NLP concepts and cutting-edge LLM techniques.

# What to expect?

.center[![Brief overview of the chapters of the course](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/summary.svg)]

- Chapters 1 to 4 provide an introduction to the main concepts of the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!
- Chapters 5 to 8 teach the basics of ðŸ¤— Datasets and ðŸ¤— Tokenizers before diving into classic NLP tasks and LLM techniques. By the end of this part, you will be able to tackle the most common language processing challenges by yourself.
- Chapter 9 goes beyond NLP to cover how to build and share demos of your models on the ðŸ¤— Hub. By the end of this part, you will be ready to showcase your ðŸ¤— Transformers application to the world!
- Chapters 10 to 12 dive into advanced LLM topics like fine-tuning, curating high-quality datasets, and building reasoning models.

This course:
- Requires a good knowledge of Python
- Is better taken after an introductory deep learning course
- Does not expect prior PyTorch or TensorFlow knowledge, though some familiarity will help

???
Now, let's talk about what you can expect from this course. We'll start with an introduction to the Transformers library, followed by exploring Datasets and Tokenizers. We'll then dive into classic NLP tasks and LLM techniques. By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to tackle common language processing challenges and even build and share your own models. This course assumes a good knowledge of Python and is best taken after an introductory deep learning course.
